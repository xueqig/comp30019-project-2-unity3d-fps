- [x] The procedural generation technique and/or algorithm used, including a high level description of the implementation details.

- [x] Descriptions of how the custom shaders work (and which two should be marked).

- [x] A description of the particle system you wish to be marked and how to locate it in your Unity project.

- [x] Description of the querying and observational methods used, including a description of the participants (how many, demographics), description of the methodology (which techniques did you use, what did you have participants do, how did you record the data), and feedback gathered.
